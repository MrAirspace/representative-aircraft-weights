# representative-aircraft-weights

WiP (status 04.2024)

Database featuring **representative** weights for aircraft take-off and landing phases of flight.
Too many times, performance calculations are performed using max take off weight. 


Representative aircraft weights/masses:
(1) take-off weight (2) landing weight

Can be used to:
(1) calculate take-off run required (TORR) (2) calculate landing distance required (LDR)
(3) calculate take-off speeds (V1, Vr, V2, V2+15KIAS) (4) calculate landing speeds (Vref, Vapp)
(3) calculate aircraft classification number (ACN) values for representative weights

Provided for following profiles:
(1) A320 - short haul sector
(2) ... - ...

For simulation and airport planning purposes as reference only.
